## Description
This project implements a simplified version of Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm using polynomial interpolation. It reads input from a JSON file containing a series of polynomial roots, decodes the y-values using different bases, and calculates the secret constant term \( c \) of the polynomial.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 21
- Maven (optional, for managing dependencies)

## Dependencies
- **JSON-java Library**: This project requires the `json-20210307.jar` file for JSON parsing. You can download it from the following link:
